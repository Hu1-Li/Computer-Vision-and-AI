Panoramic Image Stitching

Combines multiple overlapping images into a single panoramic image mosaic.

List of files:
    applyHomography.m
    autoMosaic.m
    computeHomography.m
    cornerDetector.m
    generateHomography.m
    getDescriptors.m
    matchFeatures.m
    mosaic.m
    ransac.m

Files still needed:
    dist2.m - Calculates squared distance between two sets of points
        This can be found: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/html-files/EE148-2002/dist2.m
    imgrad.m - compute smoothed x,y image derivatives
    smm.m - spatially averaged second moment matrix

    These files will be added at a later time

To run:
    In the MATLAB console, type
    > [J] = mosaic(images,basePts,inputPts)
    To manually stitch the provided images
        (use cpselect.m and cpcorr.m for help selecting corresponding points between two images)

    Or
    > [J] = autoMosaic(images)
    To automatically stitch the provided images

    Where:
        images is a cell array of images to be mosaiced
        basePts is a cell array of coordinates for given image
        inputPts is a cell array of coordinates for matching points in next image
