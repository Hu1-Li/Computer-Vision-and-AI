Image Alignment

Aligns three color channels of images from the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection to create a single, color image. This was implemented in two ways. 
    The first is a brute force algorithm, which exhaustively searches over all possible channel displacements over a 20 pixel range in every direction.
    The second is an image pyramid implementation which reduces alignment time significantly over the brute-forced method.
This project requires images from the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection.

List of files:
    alignlevel.m
    getoffset.m
    pyramidalign.m
    bruteforce.m
    getoffset2.m
    ssd.m

To run:   
    In the MATLAB console, type
    > [J] = bruteforce(I)
    For the brute force algorithm

    Or
    > [J] = pyramidalign(I)
    For the image pyramid algorithm
   
    Where 'I' is an image from the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection
