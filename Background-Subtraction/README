Background-Subtraction
	
A quick set of MATLAB functions written to do static background subtraction.
Takes a stream of images from a non-moving camera and builds a Gaussian model of the background. The test script draws a bounding box around objects not part of the background.

List of files:
	bgSubtract.m 
	detectChange.m
	determineBackground.m
	runTestBGRemoval.m
	takePicture.m

To run: 
	In the MATLAB console, type
	> runTestBGRemoval

This project requires an OpenCV wrapper to link MATLAB with a webcam.
