Computer Vision and AI Projects

This is a collection of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence projects that I have completed over the years. Feel free to use and learn from them at your own risk. If you do end up finding any of these useful, I'd love to hear about it. Likewise, if you have any questions about implementation or suggestions  feel free to email me at keemon@bc.edu

All of the projects listed are coded in MATLAB.

List of projects:
	Background-Subtraction
		-Static background subtraction using a Gaussian model
	Image-Manipulation
		-Collections of computational photography functions
	MNIST-Digit-Recognition
		-Optical character recognition using principal component analysis (eigenfaces)
	HMM-Functions
		-Algorithms for running analysis on hidden Markov models
	Image-Manipulation
		-At this point, only has one method: anistropic_diffuse
	Image-Alignment
		-Alignment of color channels for the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection
			Includes a brute force algorithm as well as a pyramid alignment algorithm
	Content-Aware-Image-Resizing
		-Functions for intelligently resizing images 
			Based on: S Avidan, A Shamir. Seam carving for content-aware image resizing

	Panoramic-Image-Stitching
		-Functions for both manually and automatically combining overlapping images into a single panoramic mosaic
			Based on: M Brown, R Szeliski, S Winder. Multi-Image Matching using Multi-Scale Oriented Patches
